## 1. Objective

### 1.1 Business Problem

Sales leadership currently has limited visibility into how actual won opportunity prices compare to suggested retail pricing. This gap makes it difficult to assess pricing discipline, identify margin leakage, and understand where discounting or premium pricing behaviors occur.

This analysis focuses exclusively on **closed opportunities** to ensure insights are based on realized revenue rather than pipeline or lost deals.

### 1.1 Key Business Questions

1. How does pricing performance vary across sales representatives relative to suggested retail pricing (SRP)?
2. Are certain products more likely to be sold at a premium or at a discount relative to SRP?
3. Does deal duration influence pricing outcomes, such as increased discounting or premium pricing?
